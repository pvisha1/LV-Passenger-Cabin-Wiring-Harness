🚗 LV Passenger Cabin Wiring Harness — Design & Documentation
Automotive Low Voltage (LV) Wiring Harness Project
This project demonstrates the complete end-to-end design workflow of an Automotive LV Passenger Cabin Wiring Harness based on OEM and global wiring standards such as ISO 6722, ISO 19642, LV214, USCAR-2, and IPC/WHMA-A-620.
The objective is to showcase industry-level skills in wiring design, connector selection, circuit planning, routing strategy, and documentation for real automotive applications.
